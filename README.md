# Zoo

This repo is designed to practice writing classes, constructor functions, and methods. By completing this assignment, I will have gained experience creating a new type of object with child objects, and will have practiced sharing functionality through prototypes.

## Tasks:
- [X] Create an Animal class with a constructor
- [X] Make sure all Animals have a name and date of birth
- [X] Create a method for the date of birth so that is will only be retrieved, not changed
- [X] Create a method for determining an animal's age in years
- [X] Create a **toString()** method which prints out the animals name and date of birth
- [ ] Create two specific species of Animal which extend the Animal class
- [ ] Specific species constructors *must* use the parent constructor
- [ ] Each species class must have a static method which returns the scientific name of that species
- [ ] If you create a mammal, it must be able to give birth (what should that method return?)
- [ ] If you create a reptile or bird it must be able to lay one or more eggs (what should that method return?)
- [ ] For each species create at least one other method (in addition to the things directly above) (ex. Parrots can speak, lions can roar, otters can swim...)
- [ ] Your species-specific method(s) MUST take in (and use) at least one argument. (For example, a swim method might take the argument: duration and return how far the animal swam in that time (speed * duration))
- [ ] All species must re-implement the toString() method to print out what species it is
Adventure Mode
- [ ] Write tests for your Zoo! This is how we know our code is working, and how we can create our various Animals without having a web application yet.
- [ ] Make sure you can create each type of animal species
- [ ] Make sure the animal objects you create have the correct data on them
